# AzureOCR

This project will Demo the use of Azure OCR Capabilities, how we can extract a whole line from Azure Computer Vision and then use it in our application. I've successfully extracted a whole line and am printing it as it is. How you use it depends on your scenario.

 
The Basic application is taken from Microsoft's Azure documentation
